The considerations for acting ethically in this scenario are broad, but in general reduce down to the employees preferred framework for normative ethics. Due to the contractual nature of the relation of the employee to his company, it is logical to apply a deontological theory to this situation. Taking the perspective of Immanuel Kant, in his famous work “Groundwork for a Metaphysics of Morals”, one should never act on a maxim one could not simultaneously wish to be universalized. Applying that principle to this situation, we can see that the universalization of the employee announcing to the public leads to a contradiction of will, as the temporary security . We can also see that this is true by applying the so called moral calculus of a preference utilitarian, where his premature announcement would surely accelerate exploit development. However, him first appealing to his boss, is a valid option with either perspective, as there is no contradiction in will, nor is the balance of utilitarian metrics outweighed. This is further supported by those who may appeal to natural teleology or a metaphysical final cause to ground metaethics, as this balance is clearly most conducive to the Aristotelian virtues. The clearest counterclaim, would come from the non-cognitivist, who may deny these ethical foundations all together. However, even in this case, it is in the employees rational self-interest to abide by company policy, as they would have legal grounds to fire him, and the premature disclosure to hackers would surely lead to higher risk for customers.
